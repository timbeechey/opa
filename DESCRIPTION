Description: Quantifies hypothesis to data fit for repeated measures 
    and longitudinal data, as described by Thorngate (1987) 
    <doi:10.1016/S0166-4115(08)60083-7> and Grice et al., (2015) 
    <doi:10.1177/2158244015604192>. Hypothesis and data are encoded as
    pairwise relative orderings which are then compared to determine the
    percentage of orderings in the data that are matched by the hypothesis.
