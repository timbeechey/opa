Description: Quantifies hypothesis to data fit for repeated measures 
    and time series data, as described by Thorngate (1987) 
    <doi:10.1016/S0166-4115(08)60083-7> and Grice et al., (2015) 
    <doi:10.1177/2158244015604192>. Hypothesis and data are encoded as
    pairwise relative orderings which are then compared to determine the
    percentage of orderings in the data that are matched by the hypothesis.
    Further details can be found in Beechey (2022) <doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/W32DK>.
